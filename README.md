# beamerthementnu
A LaTeX beamer theme for NTNU presentation templates

## Overview

This beamer theme implements the [NTNU PowerPoint templates]
(https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/Lage+presentasjon) for LaTeX
beamer. See usage example below.

The single theme can produce almost all the different templates, and
both in 4:3 and 16:9 format. Notably, the campus dependent version and
16:10 format are *not* implemented.

If you have technical questions, please contact [Martin Strand]
(https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/martin.strand). Do not send such 
questions to the NTNU Communications Division.


## Usage

The basic usage is the command

```latex
\usetheme[style=ntnu|simple|vertical|horizontal, language=bm|nn|en]{ntnu2015}
```

along with the special title page command

```latex
\ntnutitlepage
```

A minimal working example

```latex
\documentclass[screen, aspectratio=43]{beamer}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% Use the NTNU-temaet for beamer 
% \usetheme[style=ntnu|simple|vertical|horizontal, language=bm|nn|en]{ntnu2015}
\usetheme[style=ntnu,language=en]{ntnu2015}
 
\title[Short title]{The full and long title of the presentation}
\subtitle{Subtitle if you want}
\author[O. Nordmann]{Ola Nordmann}

## Contributions and license

The code is based on [Håvard Berland's original work in 2005]
(http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~berland/ntnubeamer/). In private conversation
in December 2015, Berland licensed his code under a [Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License]
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and so naturally goes 
for all code in this repository.

However, the design is owned by NTNU, and should not be altered 
substantially without checking it with the [Communication Division]
(https://www.ntnu.no/adm/komm).

So far, this is built using duct tape and chewing gum, so any 
contribution to improve the code is very welcome.

This theme also includes code from the following sources:

## beamerthementnu2017

As of May 2017, there is a new set of theme files located in 
the folder `beamerthementnu2017'. It should currently be considered being
in a beta stage, and is recommended for those who want more flexibility,
but are willing to risk some hickups (and preferably have the time to
report such issues, or even submit fixes).

Here are some of the improvements in the new theme:
 - All files are localized
 - Full support for biblatex
 - There is now an option to show which city you belong to, in those rare cases that is important
 - The overall size is reduced, due to fewer and smaller pictures
 
As a principle, the code is as lightweight as practically possible, and
only using packages when really necessary. For example, while some of
the graphics could have been generated by TikZ, an image is included
instead.

There is also a small setback, which can be fixed if someone needs it
 - Graphics are no longer included in eps
 
The new implementation is scheduled to replace beamerntnu2015 as soon
as it has sufficiently few bugs.
