# BeamerNTNU

A LaTeX beamer theme for NTNU presentations

## Overview

This is based on the official Powerpoint templates and the beamer theme guidelines.
The [documentation](https://github.com/ntnu-tex/beamerthementnu/blob/master/ntnu-beamer-documentation.pdf) provides more detail on how to get started, also for people who are not that expierienced in using LaTeX (See “Start a Presentation”).
The theme covers both an english and a norwegian option as well as three different styles.
